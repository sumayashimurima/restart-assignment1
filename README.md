1.What is the difference between `null` and `undefined`?
ans:The main difference between `null` and `undefined` is that undefined means not defined yet,its type is undefined and null means define but keep empty purpose fully and null type is object.

2.What is the use of the `map()` function in JavaScript? How is it different from `forEach()`?
ans:map() is an array method that creates a new array  from each element of a function, and it must return a value and it does not modefy the original array
other hand forEach() is used for executing a function for each element of a array and it does not return any value and it used for loop 

3.What is the difference between `==` and `===`?
ans: == is compare only value and if type is diffrent then it convert value and === is compare both value and data type if type is diffrent than give result false

4.What is the significance of `async`/`await` in fetching API data?
ans:async is significant because it is time-consuming it makes function and return promise but await pauses execution until the Promise return and it improve errer handling using try-catch both handle asynchonous operation

5.Explain the concept of Scope in JavaScript (Global, Function, Block).
ans:Scope means where a variable can be accessed in a program.
if a variable declared outside the function and block has global scope.It can be accessed from everywhere in the program.
if a variable declared inside a function and it can be asscessable within that function.It cannot be accessed outside of the function.
if a block is anything inside any kind of loop like if-else,for,while,do-while etc.Variables declared with let and const inside a block are accessible only inside that block.
